The generator runs entirely in your browser, no files or data are sent to a server.

This is a 'Vampire: The Masquerade' character creation tool for beginners. It is intentionally streamlined and limited to creating a common type of character following the rules from the source book. You can download your character into a printable PDF when you're done (PDF template kindly provided by [Nerdbert](https://linktr.ee/nerdbert)) and also save it to a local JSON file that you can load into this web app to continue editing.



## How to run
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## How to use


<!-- ## How to use your own fillable pdf
* Convert your pdf to base64 (you can use `scripts/pdfToBase64.ts`)
* Import & load it in `pdfCreator.ts`
* Use `printFieldNames()` to get names of fillable fields
* Map character attributes generated in `Generator.tsx` to pdf field names -->


<!-- ## TODOs:

* Add meaningful-ish error messages when things go wrong
* Give people a way to give feedback

* Release and ask for feedback

* Add rituals for blood sorcery

* Add PredatorType icons (maybe find in Nerdberts' resources)
* Add pretty VtM logos & images  (consider https://www.svgrepo.com)
* Make things prettier in general
* Fix: Setting Specialites, then going back and setting new specialties keeps the old ones
